H.1.2 SAGE Continuation - Track Selection
==========================================

**Student:** William Edward Beckham III  
**Date:** January 30, 2026  
**Assignment:** H.1.2 "Continuing with SAGE"  
**Repository:** BECKHAMW3233/CSC-113  

## TRACK SELECTION: Track A - Programming and Software Development

### Decision Rationale

**Selected Track A** over Track B (Prompting/Engineering) for strategic alignment with cybersecurity career objectives and existing technical infrastructure.

### Track A Advantages for Cybersecurity Applications

1. **Federal Position Alignment**: Programming skills directly support GS-11/12 cybersecurity roles requiring:
   - Custom security tool development
   - Log analysis automation
   - Compliance reporting scripts
   - DevSecOps pipeline creation

2. **SAGE Project Enhancement**: Programming focus enables:
   - Python-based security automation scripts
   - Integration with existing Ollama infrastructure
   - Custom threat modeling tools
   - NIST/FISMA compliance automation

3. **Technical Infrastructure Leverage**: Builds upon existing 150+ GB local AI deployment:
   - Qwen3:32B for code generation and review
   - DeepSeek-Coder:33B for secure development practices
   - CyberSecurity Threat Analysis V2 for security-focused coding
   - BlackHat Hacker V2 for penetration testing tool development

### Track B Considerations (Not Selected)

While Track B (Prompting/Engineering) offers value in AI interaction optimization, it provides limited advancement beyond current capabilities:
- Already demonstrated advanced prompting in Week 2 tool comparison
- Current prompt library (6 specialized cybersecurity prompts) shows competency
- Limited career advancement value for federal cybersecurity positions

### Integration with Existing SAGE Framework

**Current SAGE Capabilities:**
- Automated threat modeling using STRIDE methodology
- MITRE ATT&CK framework analysis
- Network log anomaly detection
- Phishing simulation creation
- NIST compliance documentation

**Track A Development Goals:**
- Expand Python automation for cybersecurity workflows
- Develop custom security audit tools
- Create DevSecOps pipeline automation
- Build FISMA compliance reporting systems

### Technical Implementation Strategy

**Primary Development Environment:**
- Local Ollama deployment (air-gapped security)
- Specialized models for secure code development
- GitHub integration for version control
- NIST cybersecurity framework compliance

**Security-First Development Approach:**
- All sensitive development on local infrastructure
- Code security review using DeepSeek-Coder:33B
- Penetration testing validation with BlackHat Hacker V2
- Federal compliance verification throughout development lifecycle

### Expected Outcomes

Track A programming focus will deliver:
1. Enhanced technical competencies for federal cybersecurity roles
2. Practical security automation tools applicable to Fort Liberty positions
3. Demonstration of advanced AI-assisted secure development practices
4. Portfolio of cybersecurity programming projects for GS-11/12 applications

### Next Steps

Proceeding with Track A coursework emphasizing:
- AI-assisted secure coding practices
- Cybersecurity automation tool development  
- Federal compliance-oriented programming projects
- Integration with existing SAGE cybersecurity workflow framework
