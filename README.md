## Learning Log

### Week 2: AI Tools & First Collaborations
**Date:** Jan 20 - Jan 26, 2026

**What I learned this week:**
* Qwen3:32B excels in structured cybersecurity tasks (e.g., compliance tables)
* Local AI deployment aligns with federal data security requirements

**What challenged me:**
* Measuring TPS accurately required script adjustments

**What I'm proud of:**
* Built a SAGE workspace aligned with federal compliance standards

**Questions I still have:**
* How to optimize Qwen3 for real-time network traffic analysis?

### Week 3: Bad Bot Design & Friction Analysis
**Date:** Jan 27 - Feb 2, 2026

**What I learned this week:**
* How persona design directly impacts user experience
* The relationship between condescension and communication failure
* Why circular logic breaks trust in AI assistants

**What challenged me:**
* Testing intentionally broken design required patience
* Documenting frustration objectively

**What I'm proud of:**
* Created ELITESEC_GPT - a bot that demonstrates toxic technical culture
* Connected bad bot design to real-world leadership failures

**Questions I still have:**
* How to measure user frustration quantitatively in bot testing?
