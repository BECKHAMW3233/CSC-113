## Learning Log

### Week 2: AI Tools & First Collaborations
**Date:** Jan 20 - Jan 26, 2026

**What I learned this week:**
* Qwen3:32B excels in structured cybersecurity tasks (e.g., compliance tables)
* Local AI deployment aligns with federal data security requirements

**What challenged me:**
* Measuring TPS accurately required script adjustments

**What I'm proud of:**
* Built a SAGE workspace aligned with federal compliance standards

**Questions I still have:**
* How to optimize Qwen3 for real-time network traffic analysis?

### Week 3: Bad Bot Design & Friction Analysis
**Date:** Jan 27 - Feb 2, 2026

**What I learned this week:**
* How persona design directly impacts user experience
* The relationship between condescension and communication failure
* Why circular logic breaks trust in AI assistants

**What challenged me:**
* Testing intentionally broken design required patience
* Documenting frustration objectively

**What I'm proud of:**
* Created ELITESEC_GPT - a bot that demonstrates toxic technical culture
* Connected bad bot design to real-world leadership failures

**Questions I still have:**
* How to measure user frustration quantitatively in bot testing?

### Week 2 (Continued): SAGE Development Environment & AI-Assisted Coding
**Date:** Feb 2 - Feb 9, 2026  
**Assignment:** H.1.2 Track A (Code Builders)

**What I built:**
* `hello_sage.py` — Interactive SAGE introduction script
* `prompt_tracker.py` — Command-line prompt library manager built with Kevin (Qwen3:32B)

**What I learned about AI-assisted coding:**
* Local AI deployment maintains data sovereignty at cost of processing latency (5-10 min vs instant)
* AI code generation quality consistent for standard Python regardless of cloud/local deployment
* Documentation of AI collaboration workflows increasingly relevant for federal cybersecurity positions

**Technical skills developed:**
* GitHub Codespaces cloud development environment
* Python file I/O and menu-driven program design
* Professional Issue → Branch → Code → PR workflow
* Data persistence and category-based organization

**What challenged me:**
* Assignment calibrated for Python beginners - skill level significantly higher than target audience
* Documenting basic development process felt trivial compared to actual capability level

**What I'm proud of:**
* Maintained operational security through local AI infrastructure while completing collaborative workflow
* Executed complete professional Git workflow correctly
* 45-minute completion time for 2.5-hour assignment estimate

**Questions I still have:**
* How to optimize local AI processing speed for real-time security automation workflows?
* Best practices for AI-assisted development in classified/sensitive environments?

**AI Tools Used:**
* Kevin (Qwen3:32B via AnythingLLM) - Local code generation maintaining data sovereignty
* GitHub Codespaces - Cloud development environment
* Claude - Documentation formatting and proofreading assistance
