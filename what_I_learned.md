Week 3: Bad Bot Design & Friction Analysis
Date: Jan 27 - Feb 2, 2026
What I learned this week:

How persona design directly impacts user experience
The relationship between condescension and communication failure
Why circular logic breaks trust in AI assistants

What challenged me:

Testing intentionally broken design required patience
Documenting frustration objectively

What I'm proud of:

Created ELITESEC_GPT - a bot that demonstrates toxic technical culture
Connected bad bot design to real-world leadership failures

Questions I still have:

How to measure user frustration quantitatively in bot testing?
