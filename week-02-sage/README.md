What is SAGE?
“SAGE is my AI learning companion for cybersecurity projects. I’ll use it to automate threat analysis reports, draft NIST-compliant policies, and optimize Python scripts for log analysis.”
Ground Rules:
“Only use AI for brainstorming and drafts. Always verify code for security compliance before submission.”
