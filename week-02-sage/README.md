# SAGE: My Study Assistant & Guide Engine

## What is SAGE?
SAGE automates cybersecurity workflows (e.g., threat modeling, compliance reporting) using Ollama + Qwen3:32B. It aligns with federal standards like NIST and FISMA.  

## How I'll Use SAGE This Semester
1. Generate NIST-compliant policy drafts  
2. Analyze network logs for anomalies  
3. Create phishing simulation scenarios  
4. Optimize Python scripts for security audits  
5. Automate GitHub workflows for DevSecOps  

## Tools I'm Using
- **Primary**: Qwen3:32B - For structured tasks and local data control  
- **Secondary**: Claude/Gemini - For creative tasks (e.g., phishing simulations)  
- **Special Tasks**: Ollama CLI - For performance testing (tokens/sec)  

## Ground Rules for Working with AI
1. Always verify AI-generated code for security compliance  
2. Document all interactions for audit trails  
3. Avoid using cloud tools for sensitive cybersecurity tasks  
4. Use Ollama for local, secure processing  
5. Align outputs with federal standards (NIST, FISMA)
